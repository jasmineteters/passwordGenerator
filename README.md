##Personal Notes:
I had to seek all available resources to get this project done. I sought help from the TAs after class, I joined a virtual zoom group with my classmates, I watched an hour tutorial on how to do this, I spent an additional 3 hours studying JavaScript as a whole, and I spent an hour with my Tutor getting all of it to join together. Thank you to all who helped in the making of this project.
